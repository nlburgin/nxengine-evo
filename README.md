# JenkaXEngine-Evo

NXEngine-evo is Isage's somewhat upgraded/refactored version of [nxengine](http://nxengine.sourceforge.net/)

This fork/branch is for getting it to play the popular [Jenka's Nightmare](http://jenkasnightmare.srb2.org/home.htm) mod.

Because that mod makes changes to the game executable, Nx will have to be reprogrammed a bit before it will work correctly, and the data extractor needs to be massively redone.

This is not ready for use yet.
